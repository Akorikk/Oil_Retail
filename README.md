# Oil_Retail

setup.py ==> I have use -e . in the end of requirements.txt to setup my local package you can see oil_retail is my local package because inside oil_retail we are having so many components now lets say i want to import something from oil_retail so we import like this from oil_retail.configuration import data_ingestion we can only import if it is set as a local package -e . it will look particular file called setup.py inside setup.py we have to give little details it is important to do if you wanna imort anything from oil_retail we can check using pip list if oil_retail is insatll as a local package or not 

Logging ==> Logging helps your project record what is happening while the code runs.It tells you the steps, warnings, and errors so you can debug easily.It creates a history of events (in a log file) so your ML pipeline becomes reliable and production-ready.

Utils ==> if you usinf the same function again and agian in your implementation lets say you want yo read yaml file so i need to read this yaml file in each and and every component like data ingetsion data validation model trainer etc so every time you need to write the same function again and again for reading this file insted of doing this we can create a one fucntion for yaml file and  we can keep inside the utils and whenever we need it we import it from utils iw will helps you to implement the project without repeting that function if you notice i have used ConfigBox and ensure_annotation in each and every function in utils what is the use of this
